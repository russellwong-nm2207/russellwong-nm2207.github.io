      <!-- introduction -->
      It has been an established norm for university students to apply for BTO flats during the course of their studies to maximise the grants available to them.
      However, with increasing prominence of discussions over the affordability of public housing, undergraduates are starting to sweat over the possibility of the prices being out of reach considering the lagging growth in income.

      This article seeks to explore the price trends of 4-room BTO flats in non-mature estates.
      It then aims to explain the reasons behind the inclines and declines in prices throughout the period of 2008 to 2021.
      Finally, it provides informative graphical illustrations of the price trends and income growth of graduates in comparison.

      <!-- explanation of graph -->
      While the graph does not show a constant incline of the price trend, it is evident that the price in the current climate is significantly higher than in the past.
      <br>
      <br>
      The following are reasons for the incline / decline in prices across the years:

    <h5>
    <!-- explanation of graph -->
    While the graph shows a constant incline of the annual income of Singaporeans, it does not reflect the whole truth.
    With raging inflation and the government's decision to gradually increase GST to 9%, the slight increase in income does not compensate enough to the additional expense brought upon us.
    On top of that, the rise in pricing trends just shows that our ability to afford BTOs will continue to decline since annual income growth is not uniform to the growth of public housing prices.
    <br>
    <br>
    To illustrate this, the calculator function below helps you determine just how much of your annual income is required for a BTO in Singapore and shows how the amount needed rises together with your income:
    <br>
    <br>
  </h5>

    <h4 style="margin-top: -20px;">Amount Required For Housing Loan Repayment</h4>
    <form name= "f1">    
    <p><b>Enter your annual income ($): </b><input type="text" name="income" style="font-size: 20px;"></p>
    <b><p id ="calculated">The estimated amount required is: $</p></b>
    <input type="button" value= "CALCULATE" onclick="calculateEstimate();" style="border-radius:20px; color:white; background-color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">
    </form>

    <h5>
      <!-- conclusion -->
      Public housing should never be used as a for-profit tool.
      While some are struggling to put a roof over their heads or have a property to call their own, those more fortunate are treating BTOs as pawns to lap those less well-off in terms of wealth.
      Without some form of government intervention, no matter how large of a supply, this divide will exist and the promise of BTOs remaining affordable will be nothing more than a lie...
